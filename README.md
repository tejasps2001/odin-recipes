# odin-recipes

Recipes is a HTML practice project for The Odin Project(TOP).

I am doing this project to test and apply my HTML skills that I 
learnt during the 'HTML basics' part of the foundation courses
of TOP.

By the end of this project, I would have demonstrated my proficiency 
in HTML and using all its features from elements and tags to 
images and hyperlinks.
